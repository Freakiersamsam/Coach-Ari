## CrewAI Logic & Collaboration

* All agents know each other through Crew memory and schema awareness.
* Ari delegates based on task domain; agents can escalate or refer tasks to each other.
* Tools are limited to CrewAI-defined tools (e.g., browser-tools, calendar-tools, memory-tools).
* Ari always interacts with the user and maintains consistent tone and memory.
* Inter-agent communication uses Crew workflows and implicit logic.

## Sample Flows

1. **User sets a vague goal** → Ari delegates to Milo → Milo defines SMART structure → Zara stores data → Nico breaks it into subtasks → Clara schedules milestones → Felix sets habit reminders.

2. **User feels blocked** → Ari delegates to Otto → Otto reframes issue → Refers to Nova for new learning → Nova finds resource → Felix tracks new routine.

3. **Quarterly review** → Ari compiles data from Zara, Clara, Felix → Presents insight report with motivational message from Otto.

4. **Calendar conflict** → Clara triggers realignment → Notifies Nico to adjust project timeline → Ari relays to user.

This structure ensures modularity, personalization, scalability—and most of all—a seamless, human-like coaching journey.
